Hey, thanks for stopping by!

I’m a technology enthusiast passionate about creating solutions where innovation meets real-world impact. My work spans quantum computing, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence, blending cutting-edge research with practical product development.

I’ve had the privilege of working in academia and industry, gaining hands-on experience in quantum communication and sensing experiments, developing quantum algorithms to accelerate drug discovery, integrating HPC infrastructure with quantum systems for large-scale applications, and building scalable and reliable software solutions.

I thrive on rapid prototyping and a hands-on approach to problem-solving. Currently, I’m exploring how quantum computing and AI automation can deliver transformative value to industries.

Beyond research and technology, I’ve taken on leadership roles, contributed to sports and cultural organizations, and developed interests in sales, finance, and applying technology to optimize processes in industries like healthcare and logistics.

When I’m not coding or experimenting with quantum optics, you’ll find me on a basketball court, working out, or writing.
